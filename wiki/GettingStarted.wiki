#labels gettingstarted
= Prerequisites =

 * Java 1.6+
 * [http://ant.apache.org/|"Apache ant 1.8.1+"] (ant should be available in %Path% / console)

= Download = 

Download a release package from the download tab and extract it.
The content of the extracted folder should look like:
http://i18n-binder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/other/screenshotReleasePackageContent.jpg

= Usage =

== Provide i18n directory ==

Provide a directory structure filled with property files you want to convert.

== Adapt i18nBinder.properties ==

Open the _i18nBinder.properties_ within the root folder of the extracted package.
Adapt the necessary properies there.

For example 
 * the directory of the i18n files
 * the regular expression pattern for the file grouping

As default the regular expression groups locales are supposed to be at the end of the filename, like e.g.:

{{{
C:\i18n_src\subfolder1\administration_de_DE.properties
C:\i18n_src\subfolder1\administration_en_US.properties
...
}}}

If your i18n directory has another structure like e.g.:

{{{
C:\i18n_src\de_DE\administration.properties
C:\i18n_src\en_US\administration.properties
...
}}}

you have to change the grouping expression.

== Create XLS File ==

Now call 

{{{
ant createXLSFile
}}}

to create the XLS file from the properties.

This will result in a new XLS file in your root directory which if you open it will look like:

http://i18n-binder.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/other/screenshotXLSExampleFile.jpg


== Write properties back to the i18n directory files ==

If you have a XLS file you can write the changes back to the original property files.

This is done by

{{{
ant writeProperties
}}}
